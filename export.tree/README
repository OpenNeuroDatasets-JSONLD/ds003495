This dataset contains raw and preprocessed data (DWI, T1-weighted, and both resting-state and task-based functional MRI scans) acquired before and after the dStream upgrade of our Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner in 2017. Data from both sessions (pre and post upgrade) were acquired with the same sequences and participants. Unthresholded group-level temporal SNR maps and group-level GLM maps (for both the pre-upgrade and post-upgrade data as well as the post-pre difference) are available on [NeuroVault](https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9401).

## Anonymity
In accordance with regulations from the University of Amsterdam, several precautions for participant anonymity were taken.
1. The informed consents signed by all participants contained a statement that their data could be shared with third parties;
2. No mapping from personal data (name, address, etc.) and subject identifier (e.g., sub-01) exists;
2. All structural data (T1-weighted scans) were defaced (using `pydeface`; https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface);
